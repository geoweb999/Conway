// implementation of a borg cell
// borgs have a life cycle defined by the constants below:
//     baby -- mature -- parent -- zombie -- recycled Conway cell
// Borgs are not alive for the purposes of assessing neighbors for Conway cells
// Borgs assimilate one neighboring cells that are alive after they have lived MATURITY years
// Borgs begin life as a baby borg which cannot assimlate until they mature
// After MATURITY years, a baby borg becomes a mature borg
// After PARENT years, a mature borg has a 1 in 20 chance of birthing a baby borg into an adjacent ecll
// After DEATH years, a mature borg turns into a zombie (and is now alive for conway cells)
// After DECOMPOSE years, a zombie borg becomes a random live Conway cell that cannot be assimilated for 10 years
